## Project Summary

**RainCheck** is a desktop task planner built with Java Swing that helps users organize their week by combining their personal schedule with live hourly weather forecasts.

Traditional task planners ignore weather, but RainCheck bridges this gap by integrating forecast data directly into a visual week-view calendar. This helps users make informed decisions about when to schedule outdoor activities, avoid weather disruptions, and better prioritize tasks.

Users can create, edit, and delete tasks ‚Äî each with customizable priority levels, tag names and emojis, reminders, and embedded weather info. All tasks persist across sessions and are tied to secure personal accounts.

RainCheck is useful for anyone who wants to manage time more effectively while staying aware of changing weather conditions that could affect their plans.
